### Hi folks! ðŸ¤œðŸ¤› I'm David Ochando Blasco
Full stack developer

I am a passionate tech geek and developer currently engaged in several exciting personal side projects. Some of my upcoming attempts to reinvent the wheel while having fun:

- ðŸ’» I am currently working as a full stack developer at GeeksHubs, in addition to managing the faculty and other staff members of the academy.
- ðŸ§ª Working on side projects in the planning phase and taking the first steps in implementation:
  - [**raysonts**](https://github.com/Dave86dev/raysonts) âš¡: A lightning-fast JSON explorer that allows optimized JSON url loading.
  - [**storesaurusDB**](https://github.com/Dave86dev/storesaurusDB) :t-rex:: Backend for my new mongoDB project! still in early phase but starts to rock.

## Tech stack


Given my initial background wasn't directly related to web technologies, I remain firmly persuaded that web standards represent the future of development, with this conviction, I have dedicated myself entirely to mastering them. 
To my old web coding friends known as HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript, in recent years TypeScript has joined the ranks and now leads the pack! ðŸ¥‡ 

My first coding adventures had C, C++ and Visual Basic as main starrings, but honestly, since I knew JavaScript/TypeScript there was no turning back. Go has been on my radar for quite some time.
